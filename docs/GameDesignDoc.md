# Pong: Game Design Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the design for a classic Pong game. Pong is a simple yet addictive two-dimensional table tennis video game. The objective is to defeat your opponent (or the AI) by deflecting a ball with a paddle and preventing it from reaching your goal.

## Gameplay

**Core Mechanic:** Players control paddles on opposite sides of a rectangular playing field. They use the paddles to deflect a moving ball and prevent it from entering their goal area.

**Scoring:** A point is awarded to the player who fails to deflect the ball, allowing it to pass their paddle and reach the goal area.

**Winning:** The first player to reach a predetermined score wins the game.

## Game Features

**Singleplayer:** Play against a computer-controlled opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.

**Multiplayer:** Option for two players to compete locally on the same device.

**Controls:** Players use keyboards or joysticks to move their paddles up and down. Simple one-button controls (up/down or left/right for paddles) are ideal.

**Visuals:** Simple 2D graphics with a clean and minimalist aesthetic. The playing field, paddles, and ball will be represented by basic shapes.

**Audio:** Basic sound effects for ball collisions with paddles and walls, and scoring events. Optional background music with low intensity to avoid distraction.

**Difficulty:** Adjustable AI difficulty for the single-player mode, allowing players of various skill levels to enjoy the game.

## Technical Specifications

**Platform:** This game can be developed for various platforms, including PC, mobile devices (iOS and Android), and web browsers. The chosen platform will determine the specific programming languages and tools used.

**Graphics:** 2D vector graphics are ideal for a clean and scalable visual style.
Physics: Simple collision detection between the ball, paddles, and walls will be implemented to govern ball movement.

## Target Audience

Pong is a casual game targeted towards a broad audience. Its simple mechanics and easy-to-understand gameplay make it enjoyable for players of all ages and gaming experience levels.

## Monetization (Optional)

This version of Pong can be completely free-to-play. 

For future versions, optional in-app purchases for cosmetic customization of paddles or visual themes can be considered.

## Future  Considerations

**Power-Ups:** Introduce temporary power-ups that appear on the field during gameplay, granting players temporary advantages like paddle size increase, speed boost, or ball deflection manipulation.

**Game Modes:** Include additional game modes like variations in field size, multiple balls, or wrapped edges where the ball can bounce off the sides and continue play.

**Online Multiplayer:** Implement online multiplayer functionality for players to compete across a network.

This Game Design Document provides a basic framework for the development of a Pong game. The features and technical specifications can be expanded upon to create a more engaging and feature-rich experience.
